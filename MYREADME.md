# Here is the approach that I followed in solving the analytics problem.

# Well, to run the code you can just use any editor that supports python , just change the path of file to your system location where its beens saved by you.

## MAIN HIGHLIGHTS OF HOW I CARVED THE SOLUTION TO THIS ANALYTICS PROBLEM.
### 1. I follow a train test approach or in simple terms modular approach ,in this context , i took a small set of data from a big dataset provided as for the testing of the code .
### 2. Once I got the right or expected answers for the questions i ran it for the real dataset getting the solutiosn to my problem.
### 3. Analysed the complexity of each operation.
### 4. Commenting as much as possible alongside writing code, as to make it reader friendly.
### 4. As per the questions, I have assumed the following :
 #### -> a. The number of urlh overlapping . i.e I assumed overlapping of the urlh w.r.t both files and nto individual duplication
 #### -> b. Normalising as just making sure of handling NA or zero value and not a mathematical equation of the form yi = xi-min(xi)/max(xi)-min(xi).
